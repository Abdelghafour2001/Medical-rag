# Medical Assistant with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This project is a **Medical Assistant** application powered by **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. RAG combines the strengths of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Information Retrieval (IR)** to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers to medical inquiries by augmenting the response generation process with retrieved medical data.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create an intelligent assistant capable of supporting healthcare professionals and patients by:

- **Answering medical questions** based on a knowledge base of medical literature.
- **Retrieving up-to-date information** from trusted sources (e.g., PubMed, Medline, clinical trial databases).
- **Providing accurate responses** generated through deep learning models, enhanced with retrieved content to ensure relevance and correctness.

## Key Features

- **Context-Aware Medical Responses**: Using RAG, the assistant generates answers based on user queries and relevant medical documents retrieved in real-time.
- **Customizable Knowledge Base**: The system can be tailored to specific medical domains (e.g., cardiology, oncology) by augmenting the model with domain-specific medical literature.
- **Natural Language Interface**: Enables interaction in a conversational manner, making it easy to use for healthcare professionals and patients alike.

## Technologies Used

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines retrieval-based search with generative models for more accurate results.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Empowers the system to understand and process complex medical queries.
- **Medical Knowledge Databases**: Integration with external databases like PubMed for real-time information retrieval.
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: The model is built using state-of-the-art frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.

## Use Cases

- **Healthcare Providers**: Assists doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals by quickly retrieving and summarizing relevant medical literature.
- **Patients**: Provides patients with accurate, easy-to-understand medical information and guidance.
- **Medical Researchers**: Aids researchers by delivering timely access to specific medical papers and data points.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abdelghafour2001/Medical-rag.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up the knowledge base with medical literature.

4. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Future Improvements

- **Multi-Language Support**: Expanding to support queries in different languages.
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Include real-time clinical trials and medical news.
- **Enhanced Personalization**: Tailoring responses based on patient history and preferences.
